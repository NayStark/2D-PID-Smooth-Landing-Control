# ðŸš€ 2D Rocket Landing Simulation with PID Control (MATLAB)

This project simulates a vertical rocket landing using a PID controller in MATLAB. Designed as a first-principles approach to guidance and control systems, it models thrust-controlled descent from 100 meters to a smooth, zero-velocity touchdown. 

The controller dynamically adjusts thrust to counteract gravity and velocity using real-time feedback â€” demonstrating key concepts used in real-world GNC systems like those on Falcon 9 or Blue Origin's New Shepard.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- ðŸ§  **Closed-loop PID Control**  
  Controls descent with real-time altitude and velocity feedback.

- ðŸ“‰ **Realistic Physics Modeling**  
  Incorporates gravity, dynamic acceleration, velocity, and position updates.

- ðŸŽ¯ **Smooth, Precision Landing**  
  Velocity and thrust taper off naturally without forced termination.

- ðŸ§° **Fully Tunable**  
  PID gains can be adjusted to test aggressiveness, overshoot, and stability.

## ðŸ§ª Example Output

Three subplots:
1. **Altitude** â€” Descends from 100â€¯m to 0â€¯m smoothly  
2. **Velocity** â€” Controlled approach to 0â€¯m/s  
3. **Thrust** â€” Rises to decelerate, then gently decreases until reaching hover thrust to
